2015-02-25 16:39:58.909736	Perhaps I should start a daily series, "People Who Interact Poorly With Dogs."  Today's episode: my dogs are out in their own yard, minding their business, climbing on the snow banks. I am watching them because they can climb the fence (and Lucy will because she's nuts.) All of a sudden I hear someone screaming bloody murder (a woman) from across the street, probably 100 yards away, on the other side of the street (i.e., not the side our fence is on, although our fence is kin...d of close to the road.)  "DOGGY! DOGGY! NO! GET AWAY!" (Again, my dogs are 100 yards away and fenced in and not even on the same side of the street. The woman keeps walking down the street towards us going "NO DOGGY! NO DOGGY!"  Of course, screaming riles my dogs up and Logan gets his front legs on the fence and starts barking at her.  She, in turn, screams even louder and I say to Logan, "Don't bark." By now, all three dogs are totally flipping out (not barking, but doing the anxious pace-around.) She hears me tell them to come in and she goes, "Oh, thank you. Now I can elk down the street without your dogs barking at me."  I said, "They weren't barking at you until you started screaming at them." And then we went inside, leaving Moaning Myrtle behind.  (If my dogs were barky to begin with, I'd think perhaps she'd had them bark at her before, but I doubt it -- they don't bark unless provoked.)  Pro Tip: If you don't rile dogs up, they probably won't bark at you.  ‪#‎overprotective‬ See More	0.7719741632858873	10	No	Yes	No	Other	6576
